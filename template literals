//Original:

const printBill = (name, bill) => {
    return "Hi " + name + ", please pay: " + bill;
}

//Refactored:

const printBill = (name, bill) => `Hi ${name}, please pay: ${bill}`;

//Explanation: Template literals (enclosed by backticks `) allow embedded expressions. This makes string construction more readable and concise.
